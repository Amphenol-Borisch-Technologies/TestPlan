# TestPlan
Part of a minimalist functional test sequencer/test executive.
   
  Sibling project TestExecutive TestExec & TestLib are both a demonstration program and a functional test of TestPlan.
  
  TestPlan is always current; its repository is the master for ABT's developing production test sequencer.
